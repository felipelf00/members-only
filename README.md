## Members Only Page

This project was developed for me to learn and practice how to use user authentication.

It uses Express, Express-session, Passport and MongoDb

Users can register to post messages. The messages are displayed to everyone, but only members can see the author and date of each message.

Upon registration, the user can provide an admin password. Only users with admin privilege can delete messages.
